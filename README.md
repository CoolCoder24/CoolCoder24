Hello & Greetings!

Well I'm S.R.T, and I gotta say, I'm a little surprised to see someone here reading this, but since you are thank you!

Anyways... Here's a little bit about me, ig: 
- i'm working on learning web development right now (which ig you could probably tell from my repositories)
- I'm trying to learn game development (No idea how that will go)
- And... huh, not much to say really

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Well I'd love to talk if you do as well! 
we can discuss the works of humanity together!
...or about other things that people discuss about
