# Greetings!

### Well I'm S.R.T, and welcome!

Well um... how are you doing today? 
I'm not even in-person and I can sense the intense awkwardness. 

Since you're still reading this, there may be still hope to salvage this yet!

**Here's a little bit about me and my coding journey**
- I've been learning web dev for a few months and I'm trying to get better (I mean if u checked out the repositories you would know that. Judge away. But unless your judging my username don't judge too much. I appreciate it :) )
- My goal is to learn game development (you should stick around to see that happen :) )
- I'm a huge book worm. Like HUGE.
- And, yeah I got nothing...- I promise you I AM interesting   ~~i think~~

**Well I'd love to talk if you do as well!**

>Create a PR, if u wanna talk. I'm also active on discord :) -yeah ur right. Wayyy too many smiley faces-
