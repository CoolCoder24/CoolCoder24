# Greetings!

### Well I'm S.R.T, and I gotta say, I'm a little surprised to see someone here reading this, but since you are, thank you!

-----

Well um... how are you doing today? 
I'm not even in-person and I can sense the awkwardness

Since you're still reading this, there maybe still hope to salvage this yet!

**Here's a little bit about me and my coding journey**
- I've been learning web dev for a few months and I'm trying to get better (I mean if u checked out the repositories you would know that. Judge away, but hey I will get better)
- My goal is to learn game development (you should stick around to see that happen :) )
- And... yeah I got nothing...- I promise you I AM interesting ~~i think~~

-----

**Well I'd love to talk if you do as well!**

we can discuss things other people talk about... or just life in general

if your still reading this then your a great preson and you have way too much patience, but for getting through this awkward introduction I thank you :) 

>Create a PR, if u wanna talk :) -yeah ur right. Wayyy too many smiley faces-
