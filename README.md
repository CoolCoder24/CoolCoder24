# Greetings!

### Well I'm S.R.T, and I gotta say, I'm a little surprised to see someone here reading this, but since you are, thank you!

-----

Well um... how are you doing today? 
I'm not even in-person and I can sense the intense awkwardness. 

Since you're still reading this, there may be still hope to salvage this yet!

**Here's a little bit about me and my coding journey**
- I've been learning web dev for a few months and I'm trying to get better (I mean if u checked out the repositories you would know that. Judge away. But unless your judging my username don't judge too much. I appreciate it :) )
- My goal is to learn game development (you should stick around to see that happen :) )
- And, yeah I got nothing...- I promise you I AM interesting   ~~i think~~

**Well I'd love to talk if you do as well!**

we can discuss things other people talk about, like life. If you want, or we can discuss my poor usernae choices. Either or. 

if your still reading this then you're a really spectacular, great preson and you have way too much patience. But hey I appluad you for getting through this awkward introduction. Thanks for that btw :) 

>Create a PR, if u wanna talk :) -yeah ur right. Wayyy too many smiley faces-
